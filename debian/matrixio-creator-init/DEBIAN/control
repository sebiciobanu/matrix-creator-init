Description: Install scripts that can program the MATRIX Creator FPGA and SAM3 IMU.
 Install scripts that can program the MATRIX Creator FPGA and SAM3 IMU on Raspbian.
 This version includes updates for Raspbian Bookworm compatibility, primarily by
 using libgpiod for GPIO access in helper scripts.
 .
 Note on wiringpi: This package depends on libmatrixio-creator-hal, which
 historically has a dependency on wiringpi. Wiringpi is deprecated on
 Raspbian Bookworm and may require workarounds (e.g., gpio-legacy overlay)
 for libmatrixio-creator-hal to function correctly if the HAL has not been
 updated to remove the wiringpi dependency.
 .
 Note on xc3sprog: The xc3sprog drivers used by this package (sysfsgpio_creator,
 sysfsgpio_voice) likely rely on sysfs GPIO access. On Raspbian Bookworm,
 the 'dtoverlay=gpio-legacy' kernel parameter might be needed in
 /boot/firmware/config.txt for these to work.
